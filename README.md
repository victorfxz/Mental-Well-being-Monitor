## üìñ Problem Description

The global rise in well-being challenges demands robust data solutions to identify at-risk populations, analyze stress triggers, and measure care program effectiveness. This project delivers an analytical pipeline that transforms raw survey data into actionable insights through demographic segmentation, psychological pattern recognition, and behavioral trend analysis.

Recent World Health Organization reports (2023) reveal 72% of workers experience declining well-being indicators, with stress and anxiety prevalence doubling since 2019. As modern crises amplify these challenges, data-driven approaches become essential for:

- Identifying vulnerable demographics
- Optimizing resource allocation
- Tracking intervention outcomes
- Predicting emerging risk factors

Our solution addresses this through a modern data engineering pipeline that systematically processes global well-being surveys. By implementing automated ETL workflows with Mage-AI, DBT transformations, and Streamlit visualizations, we enable:

## üñ•Ô∏è Pipeline Architecture
The data pipeline architecture comprises five clearly-defined stages:

- Infrastructure
Provision and configure a local environment using Terraform and Docker. This setup includes Azurite for emulating cloud storage and DuckDB as the analytical data warehouse, ensuring infrastructure reproducibility and reliability.

- Data Ingestion
Use Mage to orchestrate the extraction of raw data from the provided survey dataset. Mage automatically uploads these data into the Azurite data lake, streamlining the data ingestion process.

- Data Loading
Transfer data efficiently from Azurite into the DuckDB data warehouse, leveraging optimized table structures (partitioned and clustered) to support analytical queries and fast data retrieval.

- Data Transformation
DBT performs comprehensive transformations and validations on the raw data stored in DuckDB. It prepares cleaned, structured, and analytics-ready data marts that ensure data quality and consistency.

- Visualization
Streamlit, in combination with Plotly, generates an interactive, insightful dashboard showcasing mental health trends, stress indicators, demographic analysis, and treatment availability. The dashboard allows users to interact dynamically, exploring the dataset through interactive charts.
